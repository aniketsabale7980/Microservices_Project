Project: Hotel-Rating Project

Description:
- Developed a microservices-based Hotel-Rating system using Spring Boot.
- Implemented communication between microservices using RestTemplate and FeignClient for efficient RESTful communication.
- Integrated fault tolerance mechanisms to enhance system robustness and resilience.
- Configured security measures using Okta for secure authentication and authorization.
- Utilized technologies such as service registry, API gateway, and config server to enhance the scalability, availability, and maintainability of the system.

Key Achievements:
- Designed and implemented microservices architecture, fostering modularity and scalability.
- Ensured seamless communication between microservices, enhancing overall system performance.
- Integrated fault tolerance mechanisms to handle failures gracefully and improve system reliability.
- Configured Okta for secure authentication and authorization, ensuring the integrity of user data.
- Integrated service registry to facilitate dynamic service discovery and registration.
- Implemented API gateway to centralize and manage API requests, enhancing security and monitoring.
- Utilized a config server to externalize configuration, improving the flexibility and maintainability of the system.
